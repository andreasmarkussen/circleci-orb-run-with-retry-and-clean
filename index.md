# Circle CI Orb for Run with Retry and Clean

* Orb Name: *andreasmarkussen/run-with-retry-and-clean*


## Purpose

To be able to rerun flaky test, and be able to clean up for each attempt.

This was greatly inspired by kimh/run-with-retry but I lacked the option for doing a cleanup, so here is that option.

Hope that you find it usefull, else create an issue or even better a pull request.
